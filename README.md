# Binary Search Tree

I created a binary search tree data structure with various searching methods. 

## Methods

1. build_tree

Builds the array into a binary search tree

2. build_tree_unsorted

Builds the array into a binary search tree but takes an unsorted array.

3. breadth_first_search(value)

Searches for a value using the breadth_first_search algorithm

4. depth_first_search(value)

Searches for the given value using the depth_first_search algorithm

5. dfs_rec(value)

Searches for the given value using the recursive depth_first_search algorithm.
